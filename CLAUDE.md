# CLAUDE.md

Guidance for AI agents working in this repository.

## What this is

A published ruleset describing how to run projects with AI agents, alone or in
a team, built on one premise: **within a session an agent remembers; across
sessions, only the repository does.** The normative content is
[`method/rules.md`](method/rules.md); everything else explains, applies or
enforces it.

**This repository is documentation, not a project run by the method.** It has
no decision records, no status artefact and no method log, and it declares no
`method.json`. The catalogue is written for other people's projects; applying
it here would produce ceremony nobody reads. Do not add that machinery, and do
not treat the check under [`checks/`](checks/README.md) as a gate on this
repository — it is a tool for adopters.

**Where that exemption stops.** It covers the coherence check as a gate, and
nothing else. `npm run lint` and `npm test` are house style and the
counter-tests; [`CONTRIBUTING.md`](.github/CONTRIBUTING.md) requires a
contributor to run both and report what they returned, and
[`.github/workflows/checks.yml`](.github/workflows/checks.yml) runs them on
every push and pull request. Requiring something of strangers and enforcing
nothing is not an exemption, it is the arrangement [E1](method/rules.md#e1)
argues against.

Two things follow for anyone writing here. The premise is about the **seam
between sessions**, never about working memory: within a session an agent
accumulates context and should keep it. And **nothing in the catalogue may
assume a single maintainer** — where a rule needs a solo-specific form, that
goes in its *Binding*, marked as such.

## Commands

```bash
npm run lint    # line width, this repository's links and spelling, install commands, plugin version, documented version and counts, copied templates
npm test        # the counter-tests for all seven checks
npm run mutate  # break each guard in turn; anything the suite still passes is uncovered
```

Zero dependencies, Node 18 or later. There is nothing to install. The first two
must be green before work is handed back. `npm run mutate` is not part of that
gate — it runs the whole coherence suite once per mutation, so it costs minutes
— but a change to a check is not finished until it has been run: a green suite
cannot tell you that a guard you added is held by nothing. To run the full
check, point it at a project that has a `method.json`:
`node checks/check-method.mjs <path>`.

## Structure

| Where | What |
|---|---|
| [`docs/`](docs/README.md) | the plain-language documentation for a reader deciding whether and how to use this; it explains and links, and never states a rule |
| [`method/`](method/README.md) | the catalogue and its guides — the normative content |
| [`checks/`](checks/README.md) | the coherence check, four house-style checks, a counter-test for each, and the mutation harness |
| [`agent-manual/`](agent-manual/README.md) | what a project copies and rewrites — `operating-rules.md` is the manual, the rest are the shapes it refers to |
| [`plugins/agent-method/`](plugins/agent-method/README.md) | the session procedures and the interview they call, as a Claude Code plugin |

## Writing conventions

- **Never name or allude to another project.** The catalogue is generalised on
  purpose: every rule stands on its own reasoning, and evidence takes the form
  of the failure a rule prevents, never a case study. This applies to real
  projects, employers and anything recognisably derived from one.
  **[`README.md`](README.md) is the one exception**, and only for listing
  projects that have adopted the method, where a reader is deciding whether to
  try it. No rule may cite one as evidence: a rule that leans on a named
  repository stops holding when that repository changes, and a reader has no
  way to tell which of the two moved.
- **A rule enters the catalogue only if it holds independently of domain** — for
  a software product as much as for a knowledge base with no code in it. When in
  doubt, it belongs in [`method/adapting.md`](method/adapting.md) instead. The
  bar is deliberately hard; it is what keeps the catalogue small.
- **Rule identifiers are permanent and never reused**, including for a rule that
  was withdrawn. Projects refer to rules by identifier, so a renumbering
  silently changes what a project claims to follow.
- **Withdrawing a rule requires an entry in
  [`method/withdrawn.md`](method/withdrawn.md) in the same change.** That entry
  is the whole mechanism by which adopters find out; adding it later means
  everyone who read the catalogue in between learned the old rule with nothing
  to correct them.
- **Rules are anchored by identifier, not by heading text** — `<a id="c2"></a>`
  above each heading. Rewording a rule must not break every link to it.
- **Prose is hard-wrapped at 80 columns**, and a link is never broken across
  lines. Checked by `npm run lint`. Tables, fenced code, YAML frontmatter and
  lines a single long URL pushes over are exempt; nothing else is.
- **Every fact has one authority.** The catalogue defines the rules; nothing
  else restates them. Where a document needs a rule, it links to it.
- Comments in the check explain **why**, not what — particularly why a check
  exempts what it exempts, since an unexplained exemption reads as an oversight
  and gets removed.

## Working with the owner

- **Surface decisions that belong to the owner before acting.** Number them
  `O1..On`, recommend a default for each, and **do not answer them yourself**.
- **An answer goes where the question is held.** In a decision record, rewrite
  `O1..On` in place as `R1..Rn` with what was decided and why. In a pull request
  or an issue, the answer is a **comment** naming the `O`-number, and the
  description is not touched. The reasoning
  is in
  [`agent-manual/README.md`](agent-manual/README.md#an-answered-question-is-a-comment-never-an-edit).
- **Stop and ask** before: changing or withdrawing a rule in the catalogue ·
  renaming a rule identifier · publishing anything (pushing to the public
  remote, changing the marketplace manifest, cutting a release) · changing the
  licence or the contribution policy.
- **Verify external facts from primary sources** and cite them. This repository
  makes claims about how a plugin runtime behaves; those claims come from its
  documentation, never from memory.
- **Language:** all repository artefacts are written in **English, British
  spelling** (`colour`, `licence` as a noun, `analyse`, `-ise` rather than
  `-ize`). Direct conversation with the owner is in **German**. Identifiers
  mirroring an external interface keep that interface's spelling.

## Delivery

- **A pull request takes the shape in
  [`agent-manual/pull-request.md`](agent-manual/pull-request.md)**, of which
  [`.github/PULL_REQUEST_TEMPLATE.md`](.github/PULL_REQUEST_TEMPLATE.md) is the
  copy GitHub reads. This repository adds no section of its own, and a check
  holds the two files together. The template carries the shape only; what
  follows is how to fill it.
- **One concern per change. The owner merges, never the author.**
- **A closing keyword is written once, where it is meant.** GitHub reads
  `close`, `fix` and `resolve` in every inflection, in commit messages as well
  as the description, and ignores the sentence around them — a negation or a
  quotation closes the ticket too. It also ignores them entirely in a pull
  request that does not target `main`. After a merge, read the ticket's state.
- **Agent assistance is disclosed in the commit**, as an `Assisted-by:` trailer
  naming what assisted. It survives a squash merge and cannot be edited
  afterwards.

## Guardrails

- **Never weaken a check to make it pass.** If the check is wrong, fix the
  check and add the case to the counter-test. If the repository is wrong, fix
  the repository. Widening an exemption to cover a real finding is the one
  change that destroys the value of every other check.
- **A new or changed check is counter-tested before it is trusted** — fed
  deliberate violations, and shown to pass on the legitimate cases nearest to
  them. Add both to
  [`checks/check-method.test.mjs`](checks/check-method.test.mjs).
- **If a claim is checkable by a command, run the command before writing the
  claim** — and run it unpiped, so a failure can actually fail.
- **Report outcomes faithfully**, including failures and skipped steps.
