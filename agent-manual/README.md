# The agent manual

This is the layer an agent works from. Everything here gets **copied into your
project** and rewritten in your words. Nothing stays a reference to this
repository, because [C3](../method/rules.md#c3) says the agent working a task
has your repository and nothing else.

## Start with one file

**[`operating-rules.md`](operating-rules.md)** is the manual. Your agent reads
it at the start of every task, and it is the answer to *"how do I stop
explaining my way of working again in every project?"*

It becomes your `CLAUDE.md` or `AGENTS.md`, and it covers:

| Section | Answers |
|---|---|
| What this is | what the project is, and what would make it a failure |
| Commands | how to build, test and check it |
| Structure | where things live, and why |
| Working conventions | the rules that exist only because of this project |
| Decisions | how a choice gets recorded here |
| Delivery | how a change reaches the trunk |
| Working with the people who decide | what gets escalated, and to whom |
| Documentation | what has to be updated alongside a change |
| Tickets | what a task must say before it starts |
| Session rituals | how a session begins and ends |
| Guardrails | what the agent must never do unasked |

Everything below is a shape that file refers to. Take what it points at, leave
the rest.

## The shapes it refers to

| Template | Becomes | Role |
|---|---|---|
| [`method.json`](method.json) | `method.json` | the declaration the check reads |
| [`decision-record.md`](decision-record.md) | `docs/adr/NNNN-slug.md` | one entry under `decisions` |
| [`decision-index.md`](decision-index.md) | `docs/adr/README.md` | the index under `decisions` |
| [`status.md`](status.md) | `docs/STATUS.md` | `state` |
| [`method-log.md`](method-log.md) | `docs/method-log.md` | `method-log` |
| [`pull-request.md`](pull-request.md) | `.github/PULL_REQUEST_TEMPLATE.md` | — |
| [`issue-templates/`](issue-templates) | `.github/ISSUE_TEMPLATE/` | — |

Starting points, not fixtures. Copy one, delete what does not apply, rewrite the
rest. A short document that tells the truth beats a complete one full of
headings nobody filled in — and if you leave a `«placeholder»` behind in a file
you declared, the check says so.

## Why the manual restates the rules

An operating-rules file that says *"follow the rules at github.com/…"* is a
fetch that can fail, be blocked or be skipped, and it costs something on every
task. So the manual spells the rules out.

That looks like it breaks [C2](../method/rules.md#c2) — one authority per fact,
and here is a second copy. It does not, for one specific reason: the copy is not
meant to stay identical. Your file is the authority for *your* project, in your
words, adapted to your circumstances. `method.json` records where you diverged,
and the coherence check tells you when the catalogue moves under you. A tracked,
declared divergence is a decision. An untracked identical copy is the thing C2
warns about.

If you would rather not maintain the relationship at all, delete `method.json`
and keep the manual. Step 1 of
[adopting](../method/README.md#adopting-it) is a legitimate stopping point.

## Why the pull-request shape is fixed

[`pull-request.md`](pull-request.md) is the one shape here that is not simply
yours to reshape, and this section is where that was settled. It is written here
rather than in a decision record of its own because this repository keeps none —
the reasoning still has to be somewhere a future session reads, and this is the
document that owns the shapes.

The occasion: several projects deliver through pull requests written by agents,
carrying two generations of this template between them, and the repository the
templates were copied *from* carried none at all — so its own descriptions
followed no shape. Left alone that produces invented headings, a second
numbering scheme, and sections no template defines.

**The core set is What · Why · Verified · Open questions · Follow-ups, and a
project may add exactly one section of its own.** A fixed set is what makes two
projects' descriptions readable by the same person; the single slot is what
stops a project fighting the handbook over the one thing its reviewers there
genuinely need. Two slots and it stops being a set.

Two headings from the older generation are folded in rather than dropped:

- *Which issue / ADR it follows* → **Why**, which already asks which decision or
  ticket a change follows, and for the link. A heading of its own made two
  authorities for one fact, which is what [C2](../method/rules.md#c2) is about.
- *Merge-order caveats* → **Follow-ups**, which already covers what a change
  deliberately leaves undone and where that is recorded. The heading stood empty
  on almost every change, and an empty heading reads as "considered and found
  empty".

### An answered question is a comment, never an edit

When a decider answers an `O`-number, the answer is posted as a comment naming
that number. Nothing in the description is rewritten, and nothing is added to it
either.

An earlier version of this shape kept one line per question in the description,
pointing at the comment. It was dropped because it could not be kept. It is a
second write with a deadline: the comment has to exist before the line can link
to it, and both have to land before the merge, after which the description is
not touched. But the answer is what triggers the merge, so the window between
the two is often a few minutes, and the line was missed in exactly that window —
while the comment, which has no deadline, was not. A merged pull request that
missed it keeps a question with no answer beside it for good. The comment alone
carries everything the line did, and the platform already shows it directly
beneath the description.

The alternative is the one agents reach for unprompted: rewrite `O1..On` as
`R1..Rn` in the body, by analogy with what the operating rules say for a
decision *record*. In a record that is right — the record is the artefact, and
its history is the file's history. In a pull-request description it destroys the
question it answers. The answer gets no permalink, notifies nobody, carries no
timestamp except one typed by hand, and races whoever else is editing.

A review with the answer in it was also rejected. That is the right instrument
when the answer is a verdict on the change; an `O`-number is usually a question
about direction that outlives the branch, and a review body cannot be addressed
per question.

**Why the rule needs a destination rather than more emphasis.** *Do not answer
them yourself* asks an agent to stop and hand over, and that is measurably the
kind of rule agents do not follow.
[Yang, He and Zhou, *A First Look at Coding Agents' Compliance with AI
Contribution Rules in Open-Source
Communities*](https://arxiv.org/html/2607.26819v1) sorts
contribution rules into Refuse, Disclose, Verify and Handoff, and reports that
unaided "Refuse and Handoff sit at a uniform 0% across all four models", while
the policy file itself "was opened in only 12 of 347 non-anchor Native runs
(3.5%)". Disclose ranged from 17% to 40%, Verify from 4% to 92% — rules that add
a step get followed sometimes, rules that demand restraint did not get followed
at all. So the instruction says where the answer goes. A rule with a mechanism
is a step; a rule without one is restraint.

### Provenance goes in the commit, not the description

Agent assistance is disclosed with an `Assisted-by:` trailer on the commit. The
keyword is not invented here: curl's
[`CONTRIBUTE.md`](https://github.com/curl/curl/blob/master/docs/CONTRIBUTE.md)
defines it alongside `Acked-by:`, `Co-authored-by:`, `Reported-by:`,
`Reviewed-by:`, `Suggested-by:` and `Tested-by:`.

A trailer survives a squash merge and cannot be edited afterwards. A footer in
the description is editable by anyone with write access, which makes it a claim
rather than a record.

A template *field* was rejected, on the pattern of
[renovate's template](https://github.com/renovatebot/renovate/blob/main/.github/pull_request_template.md),
which asks whether AI tools were used with four graded answers and separately
who will reply to review comments. It is the better instrument for an open pull
request from a stranger, whose answer is unknown. Where every pull request is
agent-written the answer is always the same, and a heading whose answer never
varies teaches nothing while costing attention on every change.

### Nothing already merged is rewritten

The shape applies from its adoption forward. Existing descriptions are left
alone: editing closed pull requests retroactively is the same failure the rule
above exists to prevent, performed once per pull request.

## When the catalogue moves

These documents are the catalogue said in the second person, so a new or changed
rule can leave them a version behind — silently, because nothing here is
declared and no check reads them. S3 arrived in 0.3 and the manual went on
mentioning the state artefact without ever asking for one.

So: **a change to [`rules.md`](../method/rules.md) is read against this
directory in the same change.** Most rules need nothing here; the ones that do
are the rules an agent acts on every session.
[`CHANGELOG.md`](../method/CHANGELOG.md) is where an adopter finds out what
moved, and it says which entries reached the manual.
