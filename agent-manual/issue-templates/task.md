<!--
Copy to .github/ISSUE_TEMPLATE/task.md (or convert to a .yml form).

Agents write the tickets too, so hold a ticket to the same bar as the work. The
readiness section is not ceremony: an agent given an under-specified ticket will
fill the gaps by inference rather than by asking, and the inference is invisible
in the result.

## Context

<!-- The problem or goal, and why it exists. Enough that someone with the
     repository and nothing else can act on it. -->

## Scope

<!-- For a decision: the choices that have to be made.
     For implementation: testable acceptance criteria, one per line. -->

- [ ] «criterion»

## Constraints

<!-- Anything that limits the solution: a decision this must respect, a legal
     or correctness requirement, a boundary not to cross. -->

## Related

<!-- Parent epic, related decisions and tickets. -->

**Ready** when: the scope above is concrete, the criteria are testable, and the
constraints are named.

**Done** when: the criteria are met **and verified**; work and docs changed
together; CI is green; the change is merged, and the ticket's state is read
after the merge rather than assumed.
