/**
 * The coherence check.
 *
 * It answers one question: does this project's declaration match this project?
 * It does not ask whether the project obeys the catalogue. Rule A1 says the
 * catalogue is a starting point and expects to be reshaped, so "compliance" is
 * the wrong frame — a narrowed rule with a stated reason is a correct state,
 * not a defect. What is a defect is a rule that vanished without anyone
 * deciding it should.
 *
 * Ten checks: `declaration`, `artefacts`, `authorities`, `adaptations`,
 * `accounting`, `links`, `placeholders`, `decisions`, `withdrawn`, `language`.
 * The last five belong to rules (C5, C3, D2, M2, L1) and run only while that
 * rule is in force; the first five are about the declaration itself. See
 * checks/README.md.
 *
 * The report ends by naming what it could *not* check. A check that stays quiet
 * about its own blind spots reads as a clean bill of health, which is rule H1
 * broken by the tool meant to enforce it.
 *
 * Usage:
 *   node check-method.mjs [project-path] [--catalogue <path>] [--quiet]
