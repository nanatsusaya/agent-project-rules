 * Counter-test for the coherence check.

 * Rule E3 says a check is not trusted until it has been fed deliberate

 * cases nearest to them. This file is that. It exists because the common
 * failure of a check is not a wrong verdict — it is a pattern that silently
 * matches nothing, reports success, and is believed.
 *
 * Each case builds a throwaway project in a temporary directory, runs the real
 * check against it as a subprocess, and asserts both the exit code and which
 * checks fired. Asserting the exit code alone would pass for a check that fails
 * for the wrong reason.
