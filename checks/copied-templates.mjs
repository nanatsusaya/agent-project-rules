/**
 * House-style check: do the templates GitHub reads still say what the handbook
 * says?
 *
 * House style rather than method, like the others: it knows this
 * repository's own paths, and an adopting project has no use for it — there the
 * handbook copy is *meant* to diverge, which is what agent-manual/README.md says
 * and what method.json is for.
 *
 * It exists because each shape has to live in two places at once and neither
 * copy can be dropped. agent-manual/ holds what projects take; only the files
 * under .github/ are read by GitHub. C2 wants one authority for a fact, so the
 * handbook is it and a command decides whether the copy still agrees — the same
 * trade install-commands.mjs makes for the three copyable install commands.
 *
 * Usage: node copied-templates.mjs [project-path]
