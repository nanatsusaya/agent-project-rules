/**
 * Mutation harness for the coherence check.
 *
 * The counter-test answers "does the check fire on a violation?". This answers
 * the question behind it: **would anything notice if the check stopped firing?**
 * Each mutation below breaks one protective mechanism on purpose and runs the
 * whole counter-test against the damaged copy. A mutation that survives is a
 * mechanism nobody is holding to account — the state E3 exists to prevent, and
 * the state a green suite is least able to reveal.
 *
 * The pattern worth knowing: survivors cluster in mechanisms whose *comment*
 * describes a bug that already happened, where the fix was made and no case was
 * added. `ROLE_RULES.state` was one of those, and it was wrong for a whole
 * catalogue version.
 *
 * No score is published anywhere, deliberately. A published score is a number
 * that goes stale without failing, which is the defect this repository already
 * met twice. Instead every mutation in the list **must** be caught: a survivor
 * exits 1. A mutation that cannot be caught belongs in `KNOWN_SURVIVORS` with the
 * reason, where it reads as a decision rather than an oversight.
 *
 * Not part of `npm run lint`. It runs the counter-test once per mutation, so it
 * costs what that suite costs multiplied by the number of mutations — minutes,
 * not seconds. Run it after changing the check.
 *
 * Usage: node mutate.mjs [--only <substring>] [--list]
