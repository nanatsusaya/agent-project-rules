# Changes

What changed, and what an adopter has to do about it. The check reports a
version difference but cannot say which rules moved; this file is the answer to
that question.

Only changes that reach an adopter are listed. Wording, examples and internal
comments are not.

**Two things are versioned here, and they are separate sequences.** A bare
number — `0.3`, `0.2` — is the **catalogue**, the version in
[`VERSION`](VERSION) and the one your `method.json` pins to. A heading that says
*checks* is the **tools**, versioned in `package.json`. They are written down
together because a check that starts deciding differently changes what your
green run means, exactly as a changed rule does; splitting them across two files
would mean two places to look for one answer.
[`README.md`](README.md#what-each-version-number-means) says which number
carries which claim.

A rule identifier is **never** reused, and no version renumbers one. Where a
rule is withdrawn, [`withdrawn.md`](withdrawn.md) carries the entry and a check
fails on documents still teaching it — this file does not replace that
mechanism.

## 0.7

Thirty-three rules in eleven clusters. One rule added and four reworded. None
withdrawn, none renumbered — every identifier you already refer to still means
what it meant.

### New rule

**[G4](rules.md#g4) — A plan can be approved instead of each change.** For one
session, the person who holds the gate may approve a plan, and within it the
agent merges its own changes. [G1](rules.md#g1) forbade that outright, and
[S2](rules.md#s2) stopped the agent before every next piece of work, so work
that had been fully planned still waited a review cycle per change and stood
still whenever nobody was there to answer.

G1's reasoning was never about how many changes sit inside the boundary; it is
about who draws it. G4 leaves that with the human and adds the five conditions
that stop the boundary moving back to the agent: the grant is explicit and ends
with the session; the plan is a closed list that expires rather than extending;
anything not on it, including a task that grew, needs a new grant; an open
question parks its task; and each change lists its judgement calls, which is
what the human reviews instead of the diffs. The first two carry the rule. The
failure it names is a run that outlives its list: the agent carries on because
the next step seems obvious, and "the human approved the plan" quietly becomes
"the human reads a summary afterwards".

The grant changes no platform setting. Where the trunk requires an approving
review, a run cannot merge past it and waits; where it requires none, the run's
merges are held by instruction, as every merge there already is.

### Worth re-reading

**[G1](rules.md#g1) and [S2](rules.md#s2) point at G4.** G1 still says there
is no exception, and G4 is not one: it is the same boundary around more than
one change. S2 counts the next entry of an approved plan as decision-free, and
nothing else.

**[G2](rules.md#g2) gains a *Binding*: questions arrive in rounds.** Where
several are open at once, a round holds them together, and no question in a
round depends on another in the same round. Asked one at a time, a long list
costs a session per question; asked all at once, some of them guess at answers
not yet given.

**[S3](rules.md#s3) moves the state artefact's update into the work.** It used
to be brought current at wind-down, and the seam after a merge brought the
living documents current too — each time in a change of its own, which costs a
review cycle and leaves the artefact wrong between the merge and the update.
Now the change that closes a task updates it in the same merge, a change that
does nothing but update it is avoided, and wind-down writes only what no
change carried. A run under G4 writes its plan in before the first entry, so a
run that stops shows where.

**[S1](rules.md#s1) gains two duties at the ends of a session.** Bring-up
compares the state artefact with the trunk and, where the last session ended
without a wind-down, reports it and proposes the repair as the first change —
it still writes nothing itself. Wind-down asks [M1](rules.md#m1)'s question
every time and says the answer, but writes an entry only on a yes: the method
log stays rare, and the question stops being skipped. **[S2](rules.md#s2)** no
longer counts bringing documents current as housekeeping.

**What you have to do.** Update your operating rules where they say the state
artefact is brought current before a session ends: the manual's opening
paragraph, *Definition of done*, the method-log bullet and *Session rituals*
carry the new wording. If you copied the procedures rather than subscribing to
the plugin, take the new `after-merge`, `session-start` and `session-end`.

Beyond that, nothing, unless you want to work from plans. If you
do, the manual's *Delivery* section has a bullet for it; name in your operating
rules who approves a plan, and in a team leave your required reviews where
they are. If you do not, drop G4 as an adaptation ([A2](rules.md#a2)) or delete
that bullet — the rule grants something, and a project that never uses it
loses nothing. Your `method.json` pin to `0.6` is reported as a difference
rather than a failure.

### Plugin

**The plugin is `0.7.0`.** The example `method.json` that `adopt` works from
now pins `0.7`. `after-merge` no longer opens a change to bring documents
current; it checks that the merged change did. `session-start` reports a
missing wind-down, and `session-end` writes only what no change carried and
always answers the method-log question. A procedure for running a plan is
still to come.

**A sixth procedure, `interview`,** carries G2's rounds out: the decisions a
piece of work needs before it starts, asked as a frontier of questions whose
prerequisites are settled, numbered `O1..On` across rounds, each with a
recommended default, facts looked up rather than asked. It ends only when
nothing is left to ask and the person confirms, and it never acts on what was
agreed. Other procedures call it by name, which is why the rename table keeps
it as `interview` in every language.

## 0.6

Thirty-two rules in eleven clusters. None added, none withdrawn, none
renumbered — every identifier you already refer to still means what it meant.
One rule was reworded, and the manual moved its pull-request instructions out
of the template and into the operating rules.

### Worth re-reading

**[G2](rules.md#g2) now says where an answer goes, and it depends on what holds
the question.** It used to say, without qualification, that answered questions
are rewritten in place as `R1..Rn`. That is right for a decision record and
wrong for a pull request or a ticket, where rewriting a description destroys the
question and gives the answer no permalink and no timestamp. The manual had
already scoped it; the catalogue had not, so a project reading only the
normative file was told to do exactly what the manual warns against. Now both
say the same thing: rewrite in a record, answer as a separate entry anywhere
else.

**The pull-request shape no longer keeps a pointer line per answered
question.** The answer is a comment naming its `O`-number, and the description
is not touched at all. The line it replaces had to be written after the comment
and before the merge, and the merge is what the answer triggers, so it was
routinely missed — leaving a merged description that asks a question for good.
[`agent-manual/README.md`](../agent-manual/README.md#an-answered-question-is-a-comment-never-an-edit)
has the reasoning.

**The operating rules say what happens to an answer given outside the pull
request** — in conversation, in a meeting: whoever next works on it posts it as
a comment, quoting it and saying when and where it was given.

**The pull-request template carries shape only.** Its instructions moved into
the operating rules, where a session reads them; a template comment is read by
somebody typing in a browser and by no agent that writes a description from a
file.
[`agent-manual/README.md`](../agent-manual/README.md#a-template-carries-shape-the-instructions-live-in-the-operating-rules)
has the reasoning.

**A closing keyword is read by a parser, and *Done* now reads the ticket's
state after the merge.** The operating rules warn, beside the step that uses
it, that the keyword is read in commit messages too and that a negation or a
quotation closes the ticket just the same. Not a catalogue rule: it is one
platform's behaviour.

**What you have to do.** If your operating rules or your pull-request template
were copied from the manual: drop the instruction to keep a
`O1 — answered: … → <link>` line; add the sentence about answers given
elsewhere; move any instruction you keep in the template comment into your
operating rules; and add the closing-keyword warning and the post-merge read to
*Done*. Nothing in the check changes, and your `method.json` pin to `0.5`
is reported as a difference rather than a failure.

### Plugin

**The plugin is `0.6.0`.** The `adopt` procedure writes a `method.json`, and the
example it works from now pins `0.6`. What the five procedures do is unchanged.

## Checks 0.5.3

Against catalogue 0.5, which does not move. **Nothing here changes an adopter's
result.** `check-method.mjs` is untouched.

### Fixes with no effect on an adopter

**The numbers this repository states about itself are now held by a command.**
`documented-counts.mjs` compared two case counts and nothing else, so the rest
of [`checks/README.md`](../checks/README.md) drifted: it undercounted the
checks, undercounted them again a sentence later, and named one fewer
counter-test than existed. Four wrong numbers in the document whose job is to
say what these checks do, and nothing failed.

It now also reads the inventory — from the file system and from the source
rather than from a run — and compares **names as well as totals**. A total is
the weaker claim: a table that loses one row and gains another keeps its count,
and a list that omits a file reads as complete. That omission is what actually
happened.

Three consequences of reading prose, each a decision rather than an accident.
Counts written as words are parsed as words, and a number the scan cannot turn
into an integer is a finding rather than a skip. A claim reworded out of the
scan is a finding too, because otherwise deleting a sentence is the cheapest way
out of a failing run. And fences cut both ways: a fenced copy of a claim is an
example, not the document making it — except where a number legitimately lives
in one, as the comment on a command, which is read from the raw text.

## Checks 0.5.2

Against catalogue 0.5, which does not move. **Nothing here changes an adopter's
result**, and it is listed only because the tools decide one more thing than
they did: `check-method.mjs` is untouched, so a run against your project is
unaffected in every particular.

### Fixes with no effect on an adopter

**The template check covers issue templates too, and is now named for what it
does.** `checks/pull-request-template.mjs` became
[`checks/copied-templates.mjs`](../checks/copied-templates.mjs) and now holds a
list of pairs rather than one. This repository's
`.github/ISSUE_TEMPLATE/task.md` had the same gap its pull-request template had:
the handbook it should be a copy of existed, and the copy did not.

Generalising on the second pair rather than writing a second check was the whole
point. A second copy of that logic would have been the defect the check itself
exists to catch, one level up.

Two mechanisms came with it. **The pair list is asserted by the counter-test
rather than used to derive its expectations** — a pair falling out of the list
is a comparison that silently stops happening while the run still reports
success about the rest — and **an empty list is a finding**. Whatever sits above
the first heading stays exempt, which now also covers the YAML frontmatter a
GitHub issue template needs and its handbook has no use for.

## Checks 0.5.1

Against catalogue 0.5, which does not move: no rule was added, changed or
withdrawn. One change can turn a red run green, and it can let you withdraw an
adaptation you should never have needed.

### May change your result

**The decision index is no longer found only as `README.md`.** D2's check
located it by that one file name. That is stricter than the rules it enforces —
[D1](rules.md#d1)'s *Binding* asks for "an index with a status column",
[D2](rules.md#d2)'s *Check* for the statuses agreeing, and neither names a file
— so a project that held the rule in full could still fail on it.

It is now looked for by three routes, most specific first: `README.md`; a
document named after the directory itself, `ADR/ADR.md`, which is how a tool
that cannot link to a folder makes one reachable at all; and failing both, the
single document in the directory carrying a status table.

**What you have to do.** Probably nothing — a project whose index is
`README.md` sees no change at all. But **if you declared D2 `dropped`,
`replaced` or `deferred` because your index has another name, that adaptation
has lost its reason.** Remove it and let the check run. An adaptation kept past
its cause is worse than none: it reads as a rule this project does not follow,
and the next session believes it.

Two things this deliberately does not do. **More than one document carrying a
status table is a finding, not a guess** — a wrongly chosen index would make
every finding after it a statement about the wrong file. And **when the index
was found by anything other than its name, the report says which document it
read and why**, so an inference you disagree with is visible rather than
buried.

The finding for a directory with no index now says it looked **by file name**,
and names the two it looked for. "No index" and "your index is not called that"
used to arrive as the same sentence.

## Checks 0.5.0

Against catalogue 0.5, which does not move here: no rule was added, changed or
withdrawn, so what your `method.json` pins to still means what it meant. The
plugin does not move either — nothing that ships to users changed.

What did change is the **manual**, and the manual carries no number of its own.
That is why a shape you may have copied is described under a tools heading.

### Worth re-reading

**The pull-request template has a fixed shape.** If you copied
[`agent-manual/pull-request.md`](../agent-manual/pull-request.md), the core set
is now **What · Why · Verified · Open questions · Follow-ups** — and a project
adds **exactly one** section of its own, declared with its reason in the
template's opening comment. Two headings that existed in an earlier form are
folded in rather than kept: *which issue or decision this follows* belongs under
**Why**, which already asks for it and for the link, and *merge-order caveats*
belong under **Follow-ups**, which already covers what a change leaves undone.
One heading for a fact that has one already is a second authority for it.

**An answered question is a comment, never an edit.** The manual used to say
that once an `O1..On` question is answered you rewrite it in place as `R1..Rn`,
without saying where. Agents carried that across to pull-request descriptions by
analogy, and there it destroys the question it answers: the answer gets no
permalink, notifies nobody, carries no timestamp except one typed by hand, and
races whoever else is editing.

The rewrite now belongs to **decision records only**, where the file's history
is the record's history. In a pull request or an issue the answer is a
**comment** naming the `O`-number, and the description keeps one line per
question. If you copied the manual before this, that is the paragraph to
replace.

Why the instruction now names a destination rather than leaning harder on *do
not answer them yourself* is measured rather than assumed, and the reasoning is
in [`agent-manual/README.md`](../agent-manual/README.md).

**Agent assistance is disclosed in the commit.** The manual now names an
`Assisted-by:` trailer, on the pattern of curl's keyword list. A trailer
survives a squash merge and cannot be edited afterwards; a line in a description
can be, which makes it a claim rather than a record.

### New, and optional

**A seventh check, and it never runs against your project.**
`checks/pull-request-template.mjs` holds this repository's own
`.github/PULL_REQUEST_TEMPLATE.md` to the handbook it is a copy of. It is house
style, like the five before it: `check-method.mjs` is unchanged, so a run
against your project decides exactly what it decided at 0.4.0.

It is worth one paragraph anyway, because the shape of it generalises. The check
compares the two files from the first heading down — the opening comment differs
by design — **and** holds the heading set to the core five. Without that second
half, one change editing both files together would grow the shape and the two
would still agree perfectly. A same-content check passes exactly the case it
exists for.

### Corrected documentation

**The stated number of checks was wrong, and had been for two releases.**
[`checks/README.md`](../checks/README.md) said "five of them" and "the other
four" when there were six, and named three counter-tests without published
figures when there were four. Nothing depended on those numbers, which is
precisely why they went stale — the case for
[`documented-counts.mjs`](../checks/documented-counts.mjs), restated by the two
figures it does not cover.

## 0.5

Thirty-two rules in eleven clusters. None added, none withdrawn, none
renumbered — every identifier you already refer to still means what it meant.
The catalogue changed its name, and that is the whole release.

### May change your result

**The method is called `agent-project-rules`, and the check requires the new
name.** `"method"` in your `method.json` must read `agent-project-rules`. The
old value is a finding, and the declaration is read before anything else, so a
project still carrying it stops the run with nothing else decided.

The old name made two claims the catalogue does not. *Agent-driven* says the
agent drives, while [G1](rules.md#g1) — the first rule here — says the agent
proposes, opens the change and stops. And *X-driven development* is a software
naming pattern, which put a domain on a catalogue whose entry bar is that a
rule holds independently of domain.

**What you have to do.** Change one line:

```json
"method": "agent-project-rules",
```

The repository is now at `https://github.com/nanatsusaya/agent-project-rules`.
GitHub redirects web traffic and `git clone`, `git fetch` and `git push` from
the old address, so an existing clone keeps working and links already written
keep resolving. Two exceptions are worth knowing — project site URLs are not
redirected, and a workflow using an action hosted here would fail rather than
follow — and neither reaches this repository, which publishes no site and ships
no action. Both are stated in
[GitHub's documentation on renaming a repository](https://docs.github.com/en/repositories/creating-and-managing-repositories/renaming-a-repository).

**Nothing will ever be published under the old name again.** That redirect
survives only while the old name stays free: a new repository called
`agent-driven-development` would break every redirect at once, including any
sitting in documents that may no longer be edited.

### Plugin

**The plugin is `0.5.0`.** Six of its files carried the old repository address
and now carry the new one. What the five procedures do is unchanged.

**What you have to do.** Add the marketplace under its new name, then update:

```
/plugin marketplace add nanatsusaya/agent-project-rules
/plugin install agent-method@agent-project-rules
```

## Checks 0.4.0

Released against catalogue 0.5. One change reaches you, and it is not the
tools' own: the check requires the new method name. What to do about it is
under [0.5](#05) rather than restated here, because the fact belongs to the
rename and not to this release.

### Fixes with no effect on an adopter

**The guard comparing the declared method name is now held by something.** A
wrong value was always caught, because the baseline declares the right one —
but *removing* the comparison was not, and then any string at all would have
named a method that does not exist. The counter-test suite gained a case
feeding the declaration the pre-0.5 name, and the mutation harness gained the
mutation that deletes the comparison. Your result does not change. What
changes is whether a green run still means the check is checking.

## 0.4

Thirty-two rules in eleven clusters. None added, none withdrawn, none
renumbered — every identifier you already refer to still means what it meant.
One rule gained a *Binding*.

### Plugin

**The plugin is `0.4.0`, and carries an explicit version again.** For part of
0.3 it carried none, so the commit SHA decided and every commit reached
installed users. Now it carries the release number, and you get an update when
a release is cut.

That is the strategy that failed once — two procedures changed under a version
that stayed at `0.2.0`, and everyone who had installed the plugin went on
running the replaced ones. It is safe to return to it because the coupling is no
longer a habit: `checks/plugin-version.mjs` fails when anything shipped inside
the plugin changed since the last release tag and the version did not, and when
the two manifests declaring it disagree.

**What you have to do.** Run `/plugin update`. If you installed during the
period with no version, you already have the current procedures and the update
is a no-op.

**Correction, written later.** The v0.4 tag declares no plugin version, in
either manifest. `0.4.0` was restored *after* the tag was made, and the rename
replaced it with `0.5.0` before the next one — so no release tag has ever
carried `0.4.0`, and the paragraph above describes release 0.4 as having a
number it does not have. What was true of it is the direction: from
[0.5](#05) the tag carries the version, which is also when
`checks/plugin-version.mjs` stopped reporting on every run that it had nothing
to compare the current version against.

### Worth re-reading

**[C5](rules.md#c5) says which link syntax it reads, and stops implying you owe
it one.** The rule is unchanged: a reference points at something that exists.
What was never said is that its automated part reads ordinary inline links and
nothing else — so a project writing wiki-style `[[doc]]` links was following C5
perfectly and getting a green `links` result from a scan that had understood
none of them.

The new *Binding* says the ordinary form is what the check can decide, and that
the rule does not require it. `[[doc]]` costs a fraction of the characters, and
where documents number in the hundreds that is the difference between a corpus
an agent can hold and one it cannot. A project reading its documents far more
often than it checks them is trading correctly.

**What you have to do.** Nothing, if you write ordinary links. If you write any
other syntax, look for the new line in the report — see below — and know that
resolving those references is yours.

### Now named in the report

**How many references the link scan actually read.** Every run says so, and
**zero** is the number to look for: the scan ran, understood nothing, and
reported success. That is the silent no-op [E3](rules.md#e3) exists to prevent,
arriving as a green result — and it was reachable in one step from a legitimate
choice about link syntax.

## Checks 0.3.0

Released against catalogue 0.3. Every entry here is a change to
[the coherence check](../checks/check-method.mjs), not to a rule — no
identifier moved and no rule was added or withdrawn.

This is the first release in which the two numbers move apart. That they read
alike is history, not coupling: the tools were last versioned alongside
catalogue 0.2, and this is their next release. They have diverged already —
the catalogue is 0.4 above.

### May change your result

**The `state` role is accounted for by [S3](rules.md#s3), not
[D3](rules.md#d3).** S3 is the rule that requires the state artefact; D3
publishes the decided-versus-built gap beside it. The check asked for D3, which
went both ways: a project that unbound `state` and adapted **S3** — the correct
recording — was told S3 was still in force, and a project that adapted **D3**
passed with S3's only automated part switched off. If you unbound `state` and
explained it under D3, that declaration is now a finding: change the adaptation
to name S3, keeping your reason and date.

**A `method.json` that parses as `null`, `false`, `0`, `""`, a number or a
string is a finding.** All of those are valid JSON and all of them used to end
the run with `OK · the declaration matches the project`, because the
declaration, artefact, authority, adaptation and accounting checks were skipped
together. A truthy primitive crashed instead. Nothing legitimate is affected: a
declaration has always had to be an object.

**An artefact bound outside the project is a finding.** `"../rules.md"` and an
absolute path both resolved and both passed an existence test, so the check
certified coherence for a project whose operating rules the repository does not
contain — the arrangement [C3](rules.md#c3) exists to rule out. Nothing is read
outside the root either before or after this change; only the binding is
rejected.

**A role that names one document is a finding when bound to a directory.**
`operating-rules`, `state` and `method-log` each name a single file.
`decisions` may be a directory or a file, because [D1](rules.md#d1)'s *Binding*
describes a directory of records and a project small enough to keep them in one
file is following the same rule.

**A role bound to an empty file is a finding.** Zero bytes passes an existence
test and supports what a missing file supports — worse than an unbound role,
because an unbound role has to be accounted for by an adaptation and this does
not. [E2](rules.md#e2) forbids judging quality and the line falls on the other
side of this: whether the artefact says anything *useful* is a review question
and stays one; whether it says anything at all is not a judgement. If you are
scaffolding a project, either write one line or leave the role unbound with an
adaptation, which is the honest form of the same state.

**The link scan stops firing on six legitimate forms, and starts seeing two it
missed.** It read `https:`, `mailto:` and `#!` as external and everything else
as a path, so `tel:`, `file:`, `ftp:`, `obsidian://`, `vscode://` and `slack://`
were all reported as broken links. Percent-encoded paths and angle-bracketed
destinations were reported broken against files that were there. In the other
direction, a link carrying a `"title"` was invisible to the scan entirely, and
reference definitions were never read at all. If you had worked around any of
this, the workaround is no longer needed; if a document has a reference
definition pointing nowhere, you will now see it.

**A `Status` heading with the value on the next line is read.** The status was
taken only from the line carrying the label, so a project using the Nygard
record — the most widespread decision-record format there is, and the one
[D1](rules.md#d1)'s *Binding* points at — had D2's only automated part decide
nothing, on every record, while the run stayed green. If your records are in
that format and one of them disagrees with the index, that is now a finding. It
was always a defect; nothing was looking.

**Two decisions sharing a number is a finding, in the files and in the index.**
Two records numbered 0001 that both agreed with the index passed in silence,
and two index rows for one number kept the last one read. A number is how the
rest of the project refers to a decision, so it cannot name two things.

**An incomplete adaptation no longer switches its rule's check off.** An entry
missing its reason or its date is already a finding, and it used to suspend the
check on the way past — the strongest possible reading of a line the check had
just said it could not read. The rule's check now runs until the entry is
complete, and the listing says which of the two happened. If you have a
half-written adaptation, expect to see the findings it was suppressing.

**A `narrowed` manual rule counts as in force again.** The figure `N rule(s) in
force are marked manual` was built from whether an adaptation existed at all,
so declaring a rule `narrowed` — a claim that it still applies — took it out of
the count while the listing above went on saying the check still runs. That
number is the one a reader uses to judge how much a green run is worth, and it
was undermined by the one adaptation kind this project built to prevent exactly
that.

**Heading slugs accept two more shapes.** A heading that is itself a link
contributes its text, not its destination. A slug with a leading or trailing
hyphen left by stripped punctuation is accepted alongside the trimmed form,
because platforms disagree about which one they generate.

**A withdrawn-rule pattern with a nested quantifier is refused.** `(x+)+`,
`(x*)*`, `(x+)*` and their relatives can take exponential time on input that
nearly matches, and the pattern is applied to every paragraph of every document
in the project — so such an entry does not fail, it hangs, with nothing saying
which pattern is responsible. Exit 2 with the entry named. The catalogue has
withdrawn no rules, so nothing existing is affected; the right moment for this
is before the first entry, which is now.
[`withdrawn.md`](withdrawn.md) states the requirement under *Format*.

**Two project paths on one command line are refused.** The last one won, in
silence: one project was checked, nothing was said about the other, and a CI
line with a stray path in it reported green about somewhere nobody looked. Exit
2, like every other unusable command line.

**A copy of the method repository inside the project is not scanned.** The
documented install command cloned into the project being checked, and the
clone's directory name is in nobody's ignore list — so the first run an adopter
made reported findings by the hundred about files that were not theirs. On a
rebuilt adopter project: 121 findings before, none after, with the skipped
directory named in the report. The copy is recognised by holding both
`method/rules.md` and `checks/check-method.mjs`, never by its name. The command
now clones beside the project, in all three documents that state it, and a
command checks that they still agree.

**A malformed `"language"` block is a finding.** It was read as
`language.spelling` and never checked, so `"language": "british"` — the obvious
mistake — produced the note saying no regime was declared, and L1 went
unverified with nothing saying the declaration had been misread rather than left
out.

### New, and optional

**`"language": { "allow": ["…"] }`.** Words the spelling scan must not report.
The scan compares against a word list, so a proper noun or a foreign word that
happens to be an American spelling of something fires — `Liter` reads as a
misspelt `litre` — and the only escape was `ignore`, which puts a whole document
outside every scan to spare one word. The exemption covers the words it names
and nothing else, and every run names them in the blind-spot section: an
exemption nobody can see is a hole. A declaration without the field is
unaffected.

### Now named in the report

**Control characters out of `method.json` are shown rather than obeyed.** Values
were printed as they came, so a string carrying ANSI sequences acted on the
terminal — and because the authorities block prints after the findings, a
declaration could scroll real findings off the screen. The exit code was never
affected, so CI could not be fooled; a person reading the run could be, and
reading the run is what `--lint` is for. Everything from outside now passes
through one filter on the way out.

**How many documents the run read, and what it never looked at.** A run over a
directory with nothing in it printed `OK · the documents scan clean` with
nothing saying it had read nothing — the most confident thing this tool says,
about no evidence at all. Every run now opens its blind-spot section with
`scanned N markdown file(s)`, names the directories skipped by default, and
names any directory it could not read. The nine skipped names are listed in
[`checks/README.md`](../checks/README.md); two of them, `vendor` and
`.obsidian`, can hold real documents.

**Which rule went unchecked when `decisions` is a single file.** The report said
the index check was skipped; it now names D2, so the blind spot is one a reader
can look up.

**A status the index invents, rather than a row that is missing.** An
unrecognised status was dropped, so the decision looked absent from an index it
was listed in and the finding named the wrong cause.

### Fixes with no effect on an adopter

**The counter-test baseline reads the catalogue's version instead of stating
it.** It stated `0.2`. From the moment the catalogue moved to 0.3, every case in
the suite emitted the version note — the exact noise the one dedicated case
exists to isolate, and that case could no longer be told apart from the rest.
Nothing an adopter runs was affected; what was affected is the argument for
trusting any of it.

### Corrected documentation

**[`withdrawn.md`](withdrawn.md) said a pattern is matched against a single
line.** It has been matched against a whole paragraph with its line breaks
folded to spaces since 0.2, which is the only way a phrase in wrapped prose can
be caught at all. Anybody who wrote a pattern from that sentence wrote it for
the wrong input.

**The agent manual now carries S3.** It referred to the state artefact in five
places and never asked for one — which is precisely the hole S3 was written to
close, left open in the layer an agent actually reads. If you copied the manual
during 0.3, add to it: the state artefact is always the same place, bring-up
reads it before anything else, wind-down brings it current, and it names a
single next step rather than everything outstanding.
[`agent-manual/README.md`](../agent-manual/README.md) now says that a change to
the catalogue is read against that directory in the same change, so the gap has
something holding it shut.

## 0.3

Thirty-two rules in eleven clusters. One rule added. None withdrawn, none
renumbered — every identifier you already refer to still means what it meant.

### New rule

**[S3](rules.md#s3) — Keep a state artefact.** The method names four roles and
required three of them. [D1](rules.md#d1) is why a project has `decisions`;
[M1](rules.md#m1) is why it has a `method-log`; [C3](rules.md#c3) is why it has
operating rules an agent can act on. `state` was read by four rules and required
by none — [D3](rules.md#d3) publishes the decided-versus-built gap beside it,
[D4](rules.md#d4) makes it the first thing read before writing,
[C1](rules.md#c1) names *where we stand* among the questions an artefact
answers, and [S1](rules.md#s1)'s bring-up reads it fresh. A project could
satisfy the entire catalogue and leave all four pointing at nothing.

The rule requires the artefact and stops there. Naming a **single** next step
rather than a list is in its *Binding*, which is a suggestion — worth doing, and
not a condition for having a state artefact at all. Nothing about how well you
write it is normative.

**What you have to do.** If you already bind `state` to a status artefact,
nothing: you were following S3 before it was written. If you left the role
unbound, the `accounting` check already required an adaptation explaining why,
so your declaration stays coherent as it is — S3 is simply the rule that
adaptation is now against.

**No check changed.** S3 is `automated` in part through machinery that already
existed: `artefacts` fails when a bound role names a file that is not there, and
`accounting` fails when a role is unbound with nothing explaining it. Whether
the artefact is *current* stays a review question under [E2](rules.md#e2).

**Correction, written later.** That last paragraph was true of the machinery and
false of the code that shipped with it: `accounting` still named D3 as the rule
behind the `state` role, so S3's automated part never ran under its own name.
Fixed under [checks 0.3.0](#checks-030), where it appears as a change that can
alter your result. The same version shipped a second gap: the agent manual went
on *referring* to the state artefact without ever asking for one, which is the
rule S3 replaced. Both are closed there too.

## 0.2

Thirty-one rules in eleven clusters. One rule added. None withdrawn, none
renumbered — every identifier you already refer to still means what it meant.

### New rule

**[G3](rules.md#g3) — The gate reviews direction and coherence, not lines.**
The catalogue referred to "review" across six rules and defined it nowhere:
[G1](rules.md#g1) said the boundary exists, [G2](rules.md#g2) said which
questions reach it, and nothing said what happens at it. G3 says the person
decides whether the change moves towards the goal and whether it fits what
already exists — and that line-level correctness is explicitly *not* theirs,
because [H3](rules.md#h3) and [E1](rules.md#e1) carry that.

Nothing you already declared becomes incoherent, and no check changes: G3 is
`manual` and necessarily so. What it may change is how you review. If your
operating rules describe review as reading everything, they now disagree with
the catalogue. In a team, decide whether the two questions sit with one person
or two, and write down which — [`adapting.md`](adapting.md) says why leaving it
unsaid means neither reviewer asks the other question.

### May change your result

**An adaptation of kind `narrowed` no longer switches its check off.** The check
previously asked only whether an adaptation existed, so a rule declared
`narrowed` — a claim that it still applies, with a smaller scope — stopped being
verified entirely. `dropped`, `replaced` and `deferred` still switch the check
off. If you narrowed a rule and relied on the silence, you will now see the
findings it was hiding. Where the narrowing genuinely puts documents outside the
rule, name them in `ignore`.

**The spelling scan no longer exempts the operating-rules artefact.** It was
skipped as a whole file, on the reasoning that a document stating
[L1](rules.md#l1) must contain the spellings it forbids. That exemption belongs
to the mention, not the file. Put a named spelling in a code span or a
blockquote; neither is scanned.

### Worth re-reading

**[G1](rules.md#g1) says what trunk protection proves, and what it does not.**
The rule is unchanged. Its **Check** is now `automated` in part: where the
required approving reviews are zero — which the rule's own *Binding* recommends
wherever one account authors and merges — the setting proves a change arrived
through a pull request, not that anyone read it.

### New, and optional

**`authorities` in `method.json`.** Three pointers to systems outside the
repository: `gate`, `tasks`, `secrets`. Nothing is fetched and nothing is
required; a declaration without the block stays coherent.
[`adapting.md`](adapting.md) has the format.

### Fixes

- A `method.json` written with a byte-order mark parses instead of being
  reported as invalid JSON.
- A catalogue defining the same rule identifier twice is refused rather than
  silently keeping the last definition.
- Every check an adaptation switched off is named in the report, in the section
  `--quiet` cannot suppress.

### Plugin

The `decision-record` procedure sets `Accepted` on the branch, before the merge,
rather than in a second change afterwards. The old order left the trunk stating
`Proposed` about a decision that had in fact been accepted.

## 0.1

First version.
